## Rest Api info

- Example of a Rest API is like you search for something and you get a list of results back from the service your requesting from.
- An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the api on the server and allows client to talk to it.
- Rest determines how the api looks like. Rest stands for Representational state transfer.
- It is a set of rules that developers follow when
  they create their api's.
- Nowadays almost all api's are rest api's.

## CRUD

- Crud is an achronym that stands for:
  - Create aka HTTP POST method
  - Read aka HTTP GET method
  - Update aka HTTP PUT method
  - Delete aka HTTP DELETE METHOD
- Examples of crud.
  - whenever having a data base of users need to be able to create user account GET or READ profile details.
  - UPDATE the profile details.
  - OR DELETE and account if the user no longer wants it.

## url to download node

https://nodejs.org/en/[https://nodejs.org/en/]

- Use node to create server side javascript applications.

## Initial Node

- In terminal npm init or npm init -y if the user doesnt wants to automatically have the package.json built.

## install Express and info

- npm install express
- Express is a web framework for Node.js. This will help us create different routes for api.
- testing endpoints on postman

## install uuid

[npmjs.com/package/uuid]

- npm install uuid
- uuid is to help give users a unique id when creating an account with unique numbers and letters making it so that other users will never have the same unique id.
- uses:
  - timestamp - Created from the system clock (plus random values).
  - namespace, SHA-1 - Created from user-supplied name and namespace strings
  - random cryptography- strong random values

```js
// make sure to import when using for example in users.js
import{v4 as uuidv4} from 'uuid'
uuid4(); //â‡¨ '9b1deb4d-3b7d-4bad-9bdd-2b0d7b3dcb6d'
```

## install nodemon

- npm i --save-dev nodemon
- doing -dev when push or publish application no one will run my server, only installing for own developing purposes. i have it installed globaly and this will not be used later.
- creating own start script in the package.json. Instead of having "test": "blahblah" replace with "start": "nodemon server.js". Can now start using nodemon or npm start in terminal.

## using import instead

- before had to do const express = require("express")
- now by adding "type": "module: in package.json it allows to be able to use import
  ```json
   "name": "express-restapi",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "server.js",
  "type": "module",
  ```

# Fix node_modules not to show in git

1. How it started. I created a github repo and started adding node packages I believe which an article on stack overflow said " the node_modules directory is already tracked as part of the repository, the .gitignore rule will not apply to it. You need to untrack the directory from git using:"
   `zsh git rm -r --cached node_modules git commit -m "removing node_modules" `
   "After this, the .gitignore rule will ignore the directory away.

Note that this will remove the directory node_modules from your other repos once you pull the changes in. Only the original repo where you made that commit will still have the node_modules folder there."

- i git add . and check the git status and saw that node_modules was no longer there.

# JSON

- json stands for javascript object notation. it is common form for sending and requesting data through a rest api.
- In json each property and value must be wrapped with quotes

```json
{
  "name": "bob",
  "email": "bob@bob.com"
}
```
